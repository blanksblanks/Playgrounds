 Island Count
 
 Given a 2D array binaryMatrix of 0s and 1s, implement a function getNumberOfIslands that returns the number of islands of 1s in binaryMatrix.
 
 An island is defined as a group of adjacent values that are all 1s. A cell in binaryMatrix is considered adjacent to another cell if they are next to each either on the same row or column. Note that two values of 1 are not part of the same island if they’re sharing only a mutual “corner” (i.e. they are diagonally neighbors).
 
 input:  binaryMatrix =
 [ [0,    1,    0,    1,    0],
 [0,    0,    1,    1,    1],
 [1,    0,    0,    1,    0],
 [0,    1,    1,    0,    0],
 [1,    0,    1,    0,    1] ]
 
 output: 6

 Matrix Spiral Copy
 
 Given a 2D array (matrix) inputMatrix of integers, create a function spiralCopy that copies inputMatrix’s values into a 1D array in a spiral order, clockwise. Your function then should return that array. Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution.
 Example:
 input:  inputMatrix  = [ [1,    2,   3,  4,    5],
 [6,    7,   8,  9,   10],
 [11,  12,  13,  14,  15],
 [16,  17,  18,  19,  20] ]
 
 output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 13, 12]
